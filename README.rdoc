= vlad-thin

Control thin with vlad.

This is thin's own <tt>example/vlad.rake</tt> (specifically https://raw.github.com/macournoyer/thin/d3bbb86eb928b262050664b7452d8e9ffbd958a4/example/vlad.rake) in a gem.  Don't ask me why it wasn't already in one..

Yell at me (via an issue) if thin’s bundled vlad.rake changes, I’m totally not paying attention.
